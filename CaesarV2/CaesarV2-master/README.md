# CaesarV2
Aims to decrypt/encrypt caesar ciphers
-Mason Dill

This is the second revision of my caesar cipher project. Although it retains the same features as the older one,
it was entirely rebuilt in Java. The algorithm is much more effecient, as it severly cuts down on the arrays and
looping, but I have identified some problems that I do not know how to fix.

It appears that the program will, sometimes, not be able to count, or store, the characters of the inputted string.
I hope I will be able to fix this in my next revision, along with improving readablilty, and if possible improving
effeciency.
