# CaesarV1
Aims to decrypt/encrypt Caesar ciphers
Mason Dill

I first created this project in my tenth grade visual basic class.
We were allowed to outline our own project as long as it included objects and file outputting.
Although these are not features I will most likely include in future updates of it, since they do not attack
the basic idea that intrests me.
Since I naturally have an interest in cryptography, I designed this project.

The user can either encrypt or decrypt strings.

To decrypt strings the user enters a string to textbox, sets the counter to 0, and presses the decrypt button.
Encrypted strings are decrypted using frequency analysis of the average amount of English characters, for every one hundred:

To Encrypt strings the user enters a string to the textbox and then uses the counter to specify the shift they wish to apply,
they then press the encrypt button.

As of uploading this, it has been almost two years and I have already identified problems with it. I will upload more 
versions in the future addressing the problems of this code.
